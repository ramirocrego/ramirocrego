### I am Ramiro D. Crego, an ecologist from Argentina. :elephant::camel::herb::earth_americas:

- ðŸŒ± My research interests are in the field of ecology and conservation biology. 
- :earth_americas: I have been conducting studies focused on assessing methodological and theoretical approaches that can bridge the gap between ecological systems and human society. I am interested in the most fundamental state variables in ecology, distribution and abundance of species, and how these state variables respond to rapid global changes. 
- :tiger2::paw_prints::satellite::chart_with_upwards_trend: In my studies I use a combination of field data collection, remote sensing and advanced modeling techniques. Results from different studies have a main focus on creating information that can help managers to make science-based decisions to protect the environment and the people that live and depend on it.
- ðŸ’¬ I am always interested in collaborations and learning from others.
